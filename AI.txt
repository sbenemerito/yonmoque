POINTS TO IDENTIFY:

A) chance to win (AI & opponent)
B) chance to flip (AI & opponent)
C) random move


A: high priority - check if there's a chance to win
* By move

☐ check if there are 3 pieces lined up
  -> all direction
  -> own color

    1) Get ID of the tile where you must place a piece to win
    2) check surrounding tiles of the ID if there's a piece you can move going to that direction
        A) it must also identify diagonal movement
    3) if there's a movable piece, move the piece to win
    4) if there's none, move/add a piece that can go to that direction

B) Flip - check if there's a chance to flip
 1) check all pieces that are next to each other
 for 2 lined up pieces:
    - If A1 is color1 and A2 is color2 check if there's a color1 that can go to A3
 for 3 lined up pieces:
    - If A1 & A2 is color1 and A3 is color1 check if there's a color1 that can go to A4

C) random move - last resort of movement

FUNCTIONS:
    > Check surroundings if you can move to a certain ID
        - send ID and color & function will determine if you can move a piece going to that direction with the same color
    > Check for lined up pieces
        A (Win):
            > check if there are 3 lined up pieces with the same color
                - get starting ID to ending ID
        B (Flip):
            > check if there are 2 or 3 pieces (color matters: check line 20)

☐ check if there are 3 pieces lined up
 color: blue
 -> BLUE BLUE WHITE X
    * call function to check if you can move a blue piece going to X
 -> BLUE BLUE BLUE X
    * call function to check if you can move a blue piece going to x
 -> BLUE WHITE X
    * call function to check if you can move a blue piece going to X

same: counter with color detector
      function to check which piece can go there
